# Retrieve Per-Country Data from the WCA's TSV Files

These python scripts are simple to use, there are just three commands necessary:

    python3 retrieve_tsv_files.py
    unzip WCA_export.tsv.zip
    python3 calculate_data.py 100

Afterward, a results.tsv file should be created within the directory that contains the per country data.


This repository is now archived. I made this project in high school for my Math SL paper. I analyzed the WCA competition data to see if the country you are from affects how well you do in the competition. If I remember correctly, the results were that there were not enough data to conclude it made a significant difference.
